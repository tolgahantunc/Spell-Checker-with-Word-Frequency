# Spell-Checker-with-Word-Frequency (Homework)

1)Word frequency in the spell checker as follows:


• Modify the WordSet class’s ﬁeld mWord to be a Map from String’s to Integers.  
• Modify the WordSet class’s LoadWordFile method to ﬁll mWord withthe words as the keys and the number of occurances of each word as corresponding the integer value.  
• Modify the SpellChecker class’s check method to return a sorted List of words where the item at index 0 is the alternative spelling with the highest occurance count.  
• Make the remaining modiﬁcations so that the program compiles.

2)It can correct words with two spelling mistakes (two edits to the original word).
